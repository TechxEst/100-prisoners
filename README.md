# 100-prisoners
# This is a model of the 100 prisoners riddle explained by Derek Muller on his Veritasium channel here:
# https://youtu.be/iSNsgj1OCLA

# Function1 runs the riddle with each prisoner starting at the box number corresponding to their prison number
### returns one value: either "live" or "die"

# Function2 simulates the riddle multimple times
### returns a list of values of either "live" or "die" and the % of "live" in that list
# Final iteration simulates Function2 multiple times 
### returns the average "live" %
### plots the results in a hist

# 100-prisoners-random
# This models the random choice of 50 boxes by each prisoner
# returns the average "live" %

# after simulating 500000 times, it still coming out 0.0%
